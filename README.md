## Hi, I'm Rudra 👋

I am a junior at Harvard College studying Computer Science & Mathematics. 🏫

I am a proud first-generation Bangladeshi-American. I am passionate about technology, business, and economics. I strongly believe that technology and the entrepreneurial spirit have the potential to empower the citizens of low-income communities and third-world countries like the ones I grew up in. I aspire to pursue these passions to the fullest to bring up the people around me and become a part of the next generation of diverse leaders in technology.
